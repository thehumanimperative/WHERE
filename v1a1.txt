< WHERE THI >

Everywhere. Anywhere possible. Wherever. THI is in space. THI is in timespace. THI is in UNIVERSE.

THI is predominantly an internet born species. Hopefully, by the time web 3.0 is out with something OWL-like, we can use machine learning to curate and grow THI. Then should be a good time to begin discussing alternatives for porting THI into a form we can host in our minds alone.
